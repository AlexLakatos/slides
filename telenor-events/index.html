      One very obvious change in the last years was that the web became much more mobile.
      Instead of desktop machines we use laptops, smart phones and tablets and all of
      these devices get more powerful by the month. They all come with different resolutions
      and connectivity issues, though and Mozilla is happy to take on the challenge of
      moving the open web from immobile machines to on-the-go computing.

      When a certain company very loudly proclaimed that the desktop is dead
      and smartphones are the future and that HTML5 is the new standard to
      power smartphones we were very happy and interested indeed. Finally
      web standards got a platform that is on the bleeding edge and very
      beautiful and we all were ready to chip in to make this an open
      experience that empowers everyone to build for these new devices.

    <footer class="notes">
      However, when native apps took off a lot of companies realised that there
      is money to be made by not keeping things open. Apps can do more than
      HTML5 can because the OS and hardware providers grant them more access and
      control the experience. If you control the software and the hardware, you
      can build great, but very bespoke products. If you allow for open technologies
      to be used, you lose control and you make less money as a hardware provider.
      As a developer, you shouldn't have to go that route.

      The responsive view in Firefox makes it easy to test what your app looks like
      in different resolutions and when you switch from landscape to portrait mode.
      Instead of resizing the window you resize the document in the browser. It comes
      with lots of presets of the sizes of common phones and tablets and you still
      have access to all the buttons and tabs of your browser.

      The latest Firefox now allows for remote debugging, which means you
      can develop on your desktop and see the results on your phone instead
      of having to send code, restart the phone or reload the page and all
      that pain. With remote debugging you can see what is going on in the
      code of your HTML5 app on your desktop while testing it in the real
      environment.

    <footer class="notes">
      The most frustrating part about this is that phone and operating
      system providers lock out browsers and JavaScript. The fun parts
      to use in a smartphone are the camera, the sensors and to use it
      to send messages to your friends and call people. To do this,
      however you'll need to write native code. Browsers, in general
      are locked out. This is not fair when you claim at the same
      time that HTML5 is the platform to bring a great future.

      As you can see we are very far down the line, the only thing

      Firefox OS is build with three components:
      Gonk is the Linux layer talking to the hardware (the same Android uses)

      The whole interface of Firefox OS is written in web technologies. This
      means phone or phone service providers can complete change the look,
      feel and functionality of the phone interface itself. This is something
      completely new and can lead to a lot of great phone innovation for
      special needs. Consider a kid's phone with three simple buttons or
      company phones that only have the apps you need for your job and nothing
      else.

      Of course a phone without apps is not going to be very interesting to audiences
      out there. This is why Mozilla has its own app store that contains apps that can
      run on a Firefox OS phone but also in the browser.
      These apps are built with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript and all you need to give us
      to be part of it is a manifest file.

      You can run Firefox OS on your own computer inside Firefox Nightly
      or with Desktop simulators.
      The easiest is to run it in the browser and build your apps for it
      with the environment you are familiar with.
      You can put it on your own phones but the process is not easy (yet)
      The idea of Firefox OS is to bring new, affordable web-enabled phones
      to people and not to replace Android/iOS.
