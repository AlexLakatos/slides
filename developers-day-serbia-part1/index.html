        Mozilla is much more than Firefox though. We are a not-for-profit organisation to
        promote the open web. This means we educate people on how to publish content and
        we protect people's privacy and identity and choice on the web.

      One very obvious change in the last years was that the web became much more mobile.
      Instead of desktop machines we use laptops, smart phones and tablets and all of
      these devices get more powerful by the month. They all come with different resolutions
      and connectivity issues, though and Mozilla is happy to take on the challenge of
      moving the open web from immobile machines to on-the-go computing.

      When a certain company very loudly proclaimed that the desktop is dead
      and smartphones are the future and that HTML5 is the new standard to
      power smartphones we were very happy and interested indeed. Finally
      web standards got a platform that is on the bleeding edge and very
      beautiful and we all were ready to chip in to make this an open
      experience that empowers everyone to build for these new devices.

      However, when native apps took off a lot of companies realised that there
      is money to be made by not keeping things open. Apps can do more than
      HTML5 can because the OS and hardware providers grant them more access and
      control the experience. If you control the software and the hardware, you
      can build great, but very bespoke products. If you allow for open technologies
      to be used, you lose control and you make less money as a hardware provider.
      As a developer, you shouldn't have to go that route.

    <footer class="notes">
      The most frustrating part about this is that phone and operating
      system providers lock out browsers and JavaScript. The fun parts
      to use in a smartphone are the camera, the sensors and to use it
      to send messages to your friends and call people. To do this,
      however you'll need to write native code. Browsers, in general
      are locked out. This is not fair when you claim at the same
      time that HTML5 is the platform to bring a great future.

      At arewemobileyet.com we have a live view of how far down the line
      we are in defining and implementing open APIs that will give web
      developers access to this hardware. These are standards that can
      be used by other browser vendors and are implemented in Firefox.
      As you can see we are very far down the line, the only thing
      missing still is USB and NFC connectivity, other than that all
      that is in your phone can be accessed by JavaScript.

      Firefox OS is build with three components:
      Gonk is the Linux layer talking to the hardware (the same Android uses)
      Gecko is the rendering and JavaScript engine (same as Firefox) and
