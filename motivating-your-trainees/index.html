						<h2>Hierarchy of needs</h2>
					</header>
					<footer class="notes">
						There are two assumptions:
						1. One’s motivation to perform a variety of activities arises from the necessity to satisfy the basic human needs - hunger, thirst, sleep, sex and avoiding pain, anxiety and discomfort.
						2. One’s motivation is based on the need to enhance relationships within the society i.e. self fulfilment.
						Abraham M. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory states that human needs are a series of needs starting from the basic to the complex ones:

						<h2>Importance of Motivation in Learning</h2>
					</header>
					<img src="pictures/motivation/importance.jpg"
					class="middle"
					alt="elfs could not find the image">
					<footer class="notes">
						A trainee learns best when he recognises the need and develops the desire to learn. This is through motivation. Motivation stimulates trainees to think, concentrate and learn effectively. Learning is an active process requiring a participative role. Motivation influences the rate of learning, the retention of information and desire to learn. When not well motivated, a trainee learns very little with difficulty as (s)he sees no need to learn.

						Motivating trainees to learn is a major concern in any training situation. Motivation is one of the prime tasks in teaching. The instructor should ensure that it is built in every lesson presentation. Motivation should be started during the introduction of the lesson to ensure the trainee’s interest and to direct attention to what is to be learnt. It should not stop at the introduction stage, but be continued throughout the entire lesson presentation.

					</ul>

					<footer class="notes">
						1. Show the need for the lesson

						Do not assume that trainees recognise the lessons importance. No, show the benefit of the lesson to the trainees needs.

						2. Arouse and maintain interest

						Be interesting in your lesson presentation. Be enthusiastic and illustrative, exemplary. Use effective teaching aids. Be humorous and reasonably entertaining. But your task is to teach not to entertain or cheat.

						3. Increase chances of early success

						Encourage trainees at early stages of training to work on projects that they can complete successfully. Success motivates trainees, it encourages extra effort. Success is achievement. Achievement brings pleasure, confidence and stimulation to greater effort. Failure during early stages destroys motivation.

						4. Give recognition and credit where due.

						Appreciate heartily where a trainee does a good job, individuals crave for social approval give credit where it is due. Praise generously trainees with correct and good responses. Give opportunities for trainees to show what they know. Do not embarrass slow learners.

					</ul>

					<footer class="notes">
						5. Praise, avoid blame

						Praise is a powerful reward and incentive for work well done. Blame is destructive. Offer constructive criticism in a positive diplomatic manner. Start with the good points of a trainee before mentioning suggestions for improvement.

						6. Avoid emotional responses

						Emotional reactions to trainees anger and frighten them. This distracts them from the subject being taught. Emotional outbursts interfere with learning and are demotivating.

						7. Be professional

						Set an exemplary example. Trainees emulate instructors. S/he is the model. Be motivated to teach and the trainees will be motivated to learn.

						NOTE: A dissatisfying style of teaching, poor training facilities, inefficient training and administration, and poor interpersonal relationship are demotivating to trainees.

						8. Set clear goals

						Ensure that trainees understand what you are teaching them, and what they have to know and do, as a result.

					<footer class="notes">
						Gamification techniques strive to leverage people's natural desires for competition, achievement, status, self-expression, altruism, and closure.

						A core gamification strategy is rewards for players who accomplish desired tasks. Types of rewards include points, achievement badges or levels, the filling of a progress bar, and providing the user with virtual currency.

						Competition is another element of games that can be used in gamification. Making the rewards for accomplishing tasks visible to other players or providing leader boards are ways of encouraging players to compete.

						Another approach to gamification is to make existing tasks feel more like games. Some techniques used in this approach include adding meaningful choice, onboarding with a tutorial, increasing challenge, and adding narrative.

						<li>
							Just “tacking on” gamification to your current strategy
						</li>
						<li>

						<li>
							Not giving people access to share their success
						</li>
						<li>
							Being predictable
						</li>
					</ul>

					<footer class="notes">
						Forgetting about motivation. Understanding and strategically planning around the “what’s in it for me” aspect is essential to gamification success. Companies often make the mistake of creating programs that get initial new and shiny attention, but in the end lose their audience because there is no intrinsic motivation to keep playing. Find out what motivates your audience and your game, and its intended results will win every time.
						Just “tacking on” gamification to your current strategy. Superficial gamification can lead to superficial engagement and a disappointing ROI. When and how rewards happen, and how they aggregate are components that need to be carefully considered and well integrated into the overall strategy.
						Not getting senior alignment from the get-go. Gamification can be scary for some people, especially executives who look at lost productivity as lost profit. Making sure leadership understands the difference between gamification and games will help clear up confusion and will enable them to understand and buy into your gamification strategy.
						Not giving people access to share their success. Creating a program that has a social aspect is imperative to driving motivation and success. Even something as simple as a Facebook share or Twitter post can help drive engagement. Social sharing is essential!
						Being predictable. As with most things in life, people get used to processes, and a “new” game quickly can become the “norm.” Creating a variable rewards structure, planting randomized fun mysteries throughout the user experience, and regular updates will help avoid the potential for boredom.
